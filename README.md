# Air Quality Analysis in the United States
This project analyzes the changes and trends in air quality across the United States over the past several decades, focusing on specific regions and seasonal variations. The study utilizes data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and employs time series forecasting models to predict future air quality trends.
Data used for this study from the EPA is added in the repository

## Background
The EPA uses the Air Quality Index (AQI) to measure harmful emissions in our air. This project explores how AQI is changing and identifies the regions with the most significant impacts on air quality. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of air quality trends and the factors influencing them.

## Key Findings
### Seasonal Variation:
Colder months tend to have cleaner air compared to the summer months.
Summer months generally show worse air quality due to increased emissions and weather patterns.

### Regional Analysis:
In 2022, the West Coast and urban areas experienced the worst air quality.
Some counties, such as Johnson, Wyoming, and Rio Arriba, New Mexico, have seen significant declines in air quality over the past decade.

### Long-term Trends:
The air quality in the US has improved over the past 40 years and is expected to continue improving.
The analysis uses ARIMA models to forecast future AQI, indicating a positive trend in air quality management.
